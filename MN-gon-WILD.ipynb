    "\n",
    "This notebook was utilized to document the steps in my creative process of creating a static map quadrant or 'quilt square' for the NACIS 2022 Minneapolis Minnesota Mapping quilt.   \n",
    "\n",
    "It has become a NACIS tradition to showcase an annual Map Quilt at the meeting. A handful of cartographers each volunteer to work on a small portion of a larger map. The only information provided is the Deliverable Prerequisites and their assigned quadrant. They have no idea what any other cartographers are working on for their particular quadrant. All styles are unique to each cartographer.   \n",
    "\n",
    "David Lambert, NACIS member has spear headed this project for the last 8-9 years. He is the one who stitches all of the quilt tiles back together. This year I was lucky enough to be a participant in this fantastic tradition and this notebook documents my process.  \n",

    "### Initial Inspiration\n",
    "When looking at the quadrant assigned there were two main features that caught my eye.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bell Museum   \n",
    "2. Como Park Zoo and Conservatory   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Museum and Conservatory are built around displaying and educating Minneapolis about various wildlife both local and exotic. This animal focus prompted some thoughts from me:  \n",
    "- *What if animals ruled the city again?*  \n",
    "- *What would the animals use the roads for? Paths? Leaving behind tracks?*  \n",
    "- *Would any animals claim a road as their own dedicated highway? Could mark it with animal patterns, stripes, spots, etc.*  \n",
    "- *I couldn't leave out silhouettes of animals and vegetation. Animals need somewhere to live*   \n",
    "- *If the animals had a choice in symbolizing something on the map, what would they choose? Eco-friendly items?*   \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all it became a cohesive narrative:  \n",
    "**A flip of the narrative returning Minneapolis back to a wildlife centric space.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "So I considered **Symbology/Patterns** for this area:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Road hierarchy For Patterns & Tracks**    \n",
    "- Upper hierarchy roads would have patterns  \n",
    "- Lower would have animal tracks  \n",
    "    - During my internet search for how digital cartographers incorporated tracks into their maps I stumbled across Alina Gerlee's page.  \n",

When translated she says: \"*I didn't write for a long time, but at that time I prepared a style package for naturalists - animal tracks and tracks (for point and line layers). To be installed and used by the **QGIS Resource Sharing plugin**. Take it and use it!*\"  \n",

    "At first glance this quadrant has a lot of buildings (12,078). When attempting to place a Tree SVG to every building it quickly became overwhelming, masking any other object on the map. Instead I opted to only mark buildings of a certain size. This was accomplished by adding a column to the attribute table for building polygons. Then using the QGIS field calculator to calculate area. After playing around various settings I landed on buildings with > 3000 meters squared.  \n",

Then after a few samplings of determining how many points would qualify under this I looked at the surroundings for the animal.   \n",
